This code is a revise version of [the official release](https://github.com/YicongHong/Recurrent-VLN-BERT) to adapt to [Matterport3D Simulator Version 1.0](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator/tree/master). We thank the authors for their great works! 

Note that only the `r2r_src` and `run` files need to be update. The usage of the rest files should follow the original introduction. For more details, please refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/YicongHong/Recurrent-VLN-BERT).

We also recommend you to follow our detail usage of the codes in [here]().
